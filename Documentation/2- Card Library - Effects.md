#Card Library Guide - Effects

This guide will explain how to create custom effects for cards. We created an easy-to-use, flexible system that allows for creative effects to be applied to your mod.

Effects are modifiers that are attached to specific cards, and affect the game entities in one way or another.

---

###On precise grammar...

It is important to note that the keywords and identifiers must be typed **exactly** as listed to be trustworthy of working. Misspelled words will not work at all. Capilatization must also be respected to ensure functionality.

---

##Resource effects

An effect generally takes this form for resource modification:

    trigger {
        action RESOURCE n [withPriority n] on [n random] [repeat(n)] {
            // filters
        }
    }

There are also summoning effects, but those will be covered separately.

_Note that `priority` only applies to the `whilePresent` trigger and should be omitted for other triggers._

---

###Triggers

Various triggers are available for actions to be applied on.

####`afterPlay`

- Works on all cards.
- Applies the nested effects after a card is played.

####`whilePresent`

- Not _technically_ a trigger. It's more a kind of "constant effect"
- Only works on creature cards.
- Applies the nested effects while the card is present on the Battlefield.
- It is not possible at all to use `heal` and `damage` effects inside whilePresent.

####`onStartOfTurn` & `onEndOfTurn`

- Only works on creature cards.
- Applies the nested effects at the start or end of each of the owner's turns.
- By default applies to "you", but can also optionally be provided an argument to specify which player it applies to, for example:


        onStartOfTurn { ... }
        onStartOfTurn('you') { ... }
        onStartOfTurn('opponent') { ... }
        onStartOfTurn('all') { ... }


####`onDeath`

- Only works on creature cards.
- Applies the nested effects when the creature's health reaches 0 or less.

####`pick n atRandom`

- Works on all cards.
- This is a sub-trigger and picks `X` actions from the available list whenever the trigger is activated.
- Note that the available actions list (but not individual actions) need to be enclosed in parentheses rather than curly brackets.

**NOTE**: Please see the examples below for valid actions inside `pick n atRandom` blocks. The examples will be updated as new actions are made available.

Syntax:

    trigger {
        pick n atRandom (
            { action a },
            { action b },
            ... ,
            { action z }
        )
    }

Example:

    afterPlay {
        pick 1 atRandom (
            { summon 1 of "Conscript" to "you" zone "Hand" },
            { heal 1 to 'you' },
            { damage 1 to 'opponent' },
            { change HEALTH by 2 on { creature true; ownedBy "you"; zone "Battlefield" } },
            { set ATTACK to 0 on 1 random { creature true; ownedBy "opponent"; zone "Battlefield" } },
            { doNothing() }
        )
    }

####`withProbability(0.n)`

- Works on all cards.
- This is a sub-trigger and assigns a percentage probability to an action.
- Ranges are decimal, from `withProbability(0.0)`, or 0%, to `withProbability(1.0)` or 100%.

Syntax:

    trigger {
        withProbability(0.n) {
            action
        }
    }
    
Example:
    
    afterPlay {
        // 75% chance to summon creature
        withProbability(0.75) { 
            summon 1 of 'Conscript to 'you' zone 'Battlefield'
        }
    onEndOfTurn {
        // 50% change to heal you
        withProbability(0.50) {
            heal 1 to 'you'
        }
    }

---

##Resources

Many effects manipulate resources. Following is a list of the different resources. For a description of what each resource does, please see the `Card Library - Basics.md` guide.


###Important note

The name of the resource must always be `ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES` as this is what the game server is expecting.

####Basic Resources

- `ATTACK`
- `HEALTH`
- `SICKNESS`
- `MANA_COST`
- `SCRAP`
- `SCRAP_COST`

####Behaviour-specific Resources

- `ATTACK_AVAILABLE`
- `DENY_COUNTERATTACK`
- `TAUNT`

---

##Actions

The primary resource actions are `change` and `set`. The important distinction is that you either _change value(s) by `n`_ from its current value, or that you _set value(s) to `n`_ regardless of their current value. Therefore, be careful to use the correct keyword, `change` or `set`, according to your intentions.

####`change`

Syntax:

    trigger {
        change RESOURCE by n [withPriority n] on [n random] [repeat(n)] {
            // filters
        }
    }

Examples:

    // add one health to your cards on after play
    afterPlay {
        change HEALTH by 1 on {
            ownedBy 'you'
            zone 'Battlefield'
        }
    }
    // subtract two attack from opponent creatures while present
    whilePresent {
        change ATTACK by -2 withPriority 1 on {
            creature true
            ownedBy 'opponent'
            zone 'Battlefield'
        }
    }

####`set`

Syntax:

    trigger {
        set RESOURCE to n [withPriority n] on [n random] [repeat(n)] {
            // filters
        }
    }

Examples:

    // set opponent creature sickness to 2 (wait one turn) on death
    onDeath {
        set SICKNESS to 2 on {
            creature true
            ownedBy 'opponent'
            zone 'Battlefield'
        }
    }
    // make all your Bio creatures have 3 attack while present
    whilePresent {
        set ATTACK to 3 withPriority 1 on {
            creatureType "Bio"
            ownedBy 'you'
            zone 'Battlefield'
        }
    }


---

####`withPriority`


This is only used with the `whilePresent` filter. It specifies in which order the actions are applied when the creature is present, i.e., when it enters play or upon a new turn while it is in play. Actions with the same priority are applied simultaneously. It can be any whole number but it is simpler to use `1, 2, 3` etc. The default value if not specified is `1`.

---

####`random`

This selects `n` targets at random based on the filters that follow its declaration.

Examples:

    // with damage|heal effects
    onEndOfTurn {
        damage 1 to 2 random {
            creature true
            ownedBy 'opponent'
            zone 'Battlefield'
        }
    }
    // with change|set effects
    onEndOfTurn {
        change ATTACK by 1 on 2 random {
            ownedBy 'you'
            zone 'Battlefield'
        }
        set HEALTH to 1 on 2 random {
            ownedBy 'opponent'
            zone 'Battlefield'
        }
    }

---

####`repeat(n)`

Repeats the effect action `n` times to the following targets affected by the filter.

Example:

    onEndOfTurn {
        repeat(3) {
            change ATTACK by 1 on 1 random {
                creature true
                ownedBy 'you'
                zone 'Battlefield'
            }
        }
    }

---

##Filters

- These are used to filter the effects to a particular set of targets.
- A filter uses a number of keys such as `ownedBy`, `zone`, `creature true`, `creatureType` and `thisCard()`.
- A variety of filters are available for effects, and will be explained in detail below.
- If a filter needs to take multiple arguments, seperate them with a comma. For example:

    owned by "you", "opponent"

- Individual filters must be separated either by a new line/line break, or a semicolon `;` character.


        // Both these are valid:
        on {
            creature true
            ownedBy "you"
            zone "Battlefield"
        }
        on { creature true; ownedBy "you"; zone "Battlefield }
        //
        // !!! But this one is not valid:
        on { creature true ownedBy "you" zone "Battlefield }


####`ownedBy`

This is a list of possible owners with descriptions. Note that owner values are String values, and therefore need to be contained in quotation marks.

_Note: These also apply to player effects, see "Player effects" section below._

- `"you"`: You, as the player.
- `"opponent"`: Your opponent.
- `"all"`: All players.
- `"next"`: The next player. Synonymous to `"opponent"` unless your mod supports more than 2 players.
- `"active"`: The active player, in other words to the player whose turn it is.
- `"inactive"`: Opposite of `"active"`.
- `"none"`: No player. There are no current game mechanics that use this.

####`zone`

This is a list of possible zones with descriptions. Note that zone values are String values, and therefore need to be contained in quotation marks.

- `"Battlefield"`: Creature cards that are currently in active play, i.e., in battle or on the battlefield.
- `"Hand"`: Cards in a player's hand, not played yet.
- `"Discard"`: Cards which have been discarded from battle. Sometimes also referred to as graveyard. _Not currently available as of 0.6_
- `"Deck"`: Cards in a player's deck.
- `"Exile"`: Not currently used. Cards which are exiled, which may vary depending on the mod implementation.  
- `"Cards"`: All cards loaded at game start. Not currently used as it is too meta.

####`creatureType`

A specific `creatureType` type, for example `"Mech"` or `"Bio"`. Affects all creature cards of that type.

####`creature true`

Affects all creatures regardless of their type.

####`thisCard()`

Affects the card which has the effect itself, and no other.

####`cardName`

Affects one or more _specific cards_, referencing their `card("hello")` name in the card library for a mod.

Example:

    on {
        cardName "foo", "bar"
        ownedBy "you"
        zone "Battlefield"
    }

##`heal`, `damage` _(cards)_

Causes `n` points of healing or damage to the target card(s). You should refrain to use these with a `whilePresent` trigger, as it will likely have undesired effects.

Syntax:

    trigger {
        heal|damage n on {
            [filters]
        }
    }

Examples:

    afterPlay {
        heal 1 on {
            creatureType 'Bio'
            ownedBy 'you'
            zone 'Battlefield', 'Hand'
        }
    }
    onEndOfTurn {
        damage 1 on {
            creature true
            ownedBy 'opponent'
            zone 'Battlefield'
        }
    }

---

##Player effects

These effects are targeted at affecting players directly. Please don't use those with the `whilePresent` trigger.

####`drawCard`

Draw cards from top of deck to `Hand`.

Syntax

    trigger {
        drawCard 'you', n
    }

Examples

    onEndOfTurn {
        drawCard 'opponent', 1
    }
    afterPlay {
        drawCard 'you', 3
    }

####`heal`, `damage` _(players)_

This heals or damages a target player.

Syntax:

    trigger {
        heal|damage n to 'owner'
    }

Examples:

    onDeath {
        damage 3 on 'opponent'
    }
    onEndOfTurn {
        heal 1 on 'you'
    }

---

##Summoning effects

Summoning effects create new entities of specific cards into a specified zone. This is particularly important for cards with the `token()` attribute as it is the only way to bring them into play.

Syntax:

    trigger {
        summon n of "Card Name" to "ownedBy" zone "zone"
    }

It uses the same keywords for `ownedBy` and `zone` as the other card filters.

Examples:

    // create one Conscript in your hand when this is played
    afterPlay {
        summon 1 of "Conscript" to "you" zone "Hand"
    }
    // "Deathrattle" (Hearthstone) style effect
    onDeath {
        summon 1 of "The Chopper" to "you" zone "Battlefield"
    }
