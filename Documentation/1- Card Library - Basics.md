#Card Library Guide - Basics

Creating and modifying the available cards is the quickest and easiest way to customize your game modification _[mod]_. This guide will explain the basics of what are the different attributes, properties and effects, and how to use them effectively. 

The card library uses a Groovy Domain-Specific Language _[DSL]_ to store card information. Numeric values `(1, 2, 3.14, 42, 999999999)` , as well as Boolean values `(true / false, 1 / 0)` are written without quotes. String of character values `("hello world", "http://www.cardshifter.com/", etc.)` are written either using `'single'` or `"double"` quotation marks (they act the same in the scope of your mod).

####Comments

Note that code comments are used throughout to clarify usage. Comments a single line, or at the end of a line, are like `// this is a comment`. Comments spanning multiple lines, or interrupting a line, are like:

    /*
     * This is
     * a multi-line comment
     */
 
Or...
 
    card("My Card") /* a comment */ {
        // a line comment
    }

###On precise grammar...

It is important to note that the keywords and identifiers must be typed **exactly** as listed to be trustworthy of working. Misspelled words will not work at all. Capilatization must also be respected to ensure functionality.

##General attributes

###`card("name")`

- **Required**
- Declares the unique identifier of a specific card. You must not have multiple cards with the same name, otherwise the game behavior could be unpredictable. 
- The properties/attributes/effects pertaining to that card are to all be contained within curly braces `{}` after this is declared. Please use line breaks and indentation spaces to keep the properties visually grouped together.

Usage:

    card("My Card") {
        // card properties
    }
    // or also acceptable
    card("My Card") 
    {
        // card properties
    }
    
###`flavor`

- Optional
- Flavor text that says something interesting about the card. 
 
Usage:

    card("My Card") {
            flavor "This is my favorite card of all."
    }
    
---
    
###`creature`

- Any present value declares that the card is a creature. This means that the card can be played onto the battlefield, and will be destroyed into the discard pile upon becoming `health <= 0` or otherwise being destroyed by another mechanic.
- It also displays the creature type of the card.
- For reference, the most common creature types are:

#####_"Cyborg Chronicles"_ mod

- - `"Bio"`: Creature which can have Enchantments played on it. See Enchantments section below for details. 
- - `"Mech"`: Creature which can _not_ have Enchantments played on it. Mechs often have the characteristic that they can be sacrificed for scrap resource. See related `scrap` section. This property requires that `scrap > 0` in order to take effect.

Usage:

    card("My Card") {
        flavor "This is my favorite card of all."
        creature "Bio"
    }

#####_"Mythos"_ mod

- There are no creature-type specific effects at this time. Creature type is used for labeling and targeting.

        card("My Greek Card") {
            flavor "This is my favorite Greek card of all."
            creature "Greek"
        }

##Common properties

####`health`

A creature card with `n` health can take `n` damage while it is in battle, and it is destroyed into the discard pile if the health reaches `0` or less. If you set `health 0`, your card should die immediately after being played, save some effect(s) modify health. Usage: `health n`

_Note: by default setting, Cardshifter cards will gain their health back after each turn._

####`attack`

A creature card with `n` attack can cause `n` damage  to a target card or player while it is in battle. Usage: `attack n`


####`manaCost`

A card with `n` manaCost requires spending `n` player mana points in order to play it. Usage: `manaCost n`

####`sickness`

A creature card with `n` sickness must wait `n` turns after being played before it can perform an action. A creature with `0` sickness is often referred to as having "Rush" or immediate action. Usage: `sickness n`


---

##Scrap

Scrap is an additional resource that can be used which behaves differently than Mana. By adding a `scrap` value to a creature card, the card becomes "scrappable", which means it can be sacrificed, or "scrapped", instead of performing an action while on the Battlefield. This eliminates the card and awards the owner player with the amount of Scrap resource specified.

For Scrap to be available, the following configuration code must be included in the mod's **Game.groovy** file:

    SCRAP = createResource("SCRAP")
    SCRAP_COST = createResource("SCRAP_COST")

And including the scrap configuration in the `include` section of **Game.groovy**:

    include 'scrap'
    
###Scrap properties

####`scrap`

A creature card with `n` scrap value can be sacrificed from battle after exhausting its casting `sickness`, in exchange for `n` scrap resource to the player. All cards with `scrap > 0` can be sacrificed. `scrap` resource can be used for various things which have a `scrapCost`, including most Enchantments. See the Enchantments section for details. 

Usage: `scrap n`

####`scrapCost`

A card with `n` scrapCost requires spending `n` player scrap points in order to play it. Usage: `scrapCost n`

---

##Modifiers

####`noAttack()`

Declares that a creature card cannot attack. 

####`taunt()`

A creature card with `taunt()` will require the opponent to attack that card first before other cards or the player can be attacked.

####`denyCounterAttack()`

A card with `denyCounterAttack()` will not be subject to the counter-attack mechanic. By default, the counter-attack mechanic makes it so that if a creature attacks another creature, and the target creature has `n` attack, the attacking creature will take `n` damage to health as a consequence. Enabling this will override this mechanic. This can be referred to as a "Ranged" or "Sniper" creature, in a way. 

####`maxInDeck`

Determines an arbitrary maximum of how many of one card can be chosen into a deck. It overrides the mod's default `maxCardsPerType` property (usually 3). Syntax: `maxInDeck n`

_Note: See the_ `maxCardsPerType` _property of the_ `players` _config method in the mod's_ `Game.groovy` _file to see or change the default value._

####`token()`

A card with `token()` cannot be selected from the Deck Builder. It can only be brought into play by summoning it. See `2) Card Library - Effects.md` for more details on summoning cards.

_Note: This is a shortcut to_ `maxInDeck 0` _which would produce the same effect._

---

##Enchantments

Enchantments are cards that can be cast upon creature cards which are in play. They modify the target card's properties.

**Important note:** As of 2015-07-11, the Scrap related resources_must_ be included in the mod's **Game.groovy** file for enchantment cards to function correctly. This will be addressed in the near future. 

####`enchantment true`

When declared an `enchantment true`, the card is treated as an Enchantment. An enchantment can be cast on a `"Bio"` creature in Cyborg-Chronicles to make changes to its resources.

_Note that a card cannot be both a Creature and an Enchantment._

####`addHealth`

Add `n` health to the target card. Usage: `addHealth n`

####`addAttack`

Add `n` attack to the target card. Usage: `addAttack n`

**Note**: More advanced effects are described in the `2) Card Library - Effects.md` file.
