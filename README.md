####What is Cardshifter?
------------------------

Cardshifter is an open-source, online Trading Card Game (TCG). The idea was born in summer of 2014 when a handful of software developers and programming enthusiasts from [Code Review Stack Exchange](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/) were tossing ideas around on how to come up with an innovative and fun game using the latest Java 8 technologies. 

The game is cross-platform compatible (Windows, OS X, Linux) and eventually will feature mobile versions as well. It is early in development, but we are working hard on adding new gameplay features, improving the user interface, and will eventually feature original art from content creators who have since joined the project.

####Playing the game
--------------------

To play the game, [download the latest release](https://github.com/Cardshifter/Cardshifter/releases). Start the client jar using `java -jar cardshifter-fx-<version>.jar` or by saving to your computer and simply double-clicking `cardshifter-fx-<version>.jar`. There is a server running at `dwarftowers.com` port `4242` that you may connect to and play with other players as well as AI players. If this is your first time playing Cardshifter, you may want to have a look at the [Game Rules](https://github.com/Cardshifter/Cardshifter/wiki/Game-Rules).
