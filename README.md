Developer guidelines
--------------------

In order to ease development on this project, we ask you to follow the following guidelines:
 - If a ```.travis.yml``` file is present in your branch, then the Travis CI build system will attempt to build your branch and run tests on it and accordingly notify you of success or failure.
 - Please respect the coding standards of other people in their own submodules.
 - Open issues early and often, especially if you do not have time for the project for a few days, then other people can pick up the issue and attempt to implement it.
 - Commit early and often, you are hopefully doing this locally already, but please also share your updates remotely as fast as possible, in this way others will know what you are working on and what the status is.

Coding style
------------

We would like everyone to follow the following guidelines:
 - Use the most common coding standard for the language you are coding in.
 - Use tabs for indentation in Java.
 - Use two blanks for indentation in Lua.

Platform
--------

Currently we plan to support version Java 8u20 and above.
