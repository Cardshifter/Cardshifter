/* This file contains the card extensions which define Enchantment cards.
 * An Enchantment is a card which is played onto another card (generally that target card is on Battlefield)
 *   which imbues the target with changes in resources, as well as can add certain properties or effects.
 * Depending on the mod's design, an Enchantment can be cast using Mana, Scrap, no resource at all.
 * Also depending on the mod's Game configuration, enchantments may or may not be limited to certain types of creatures as targets.
